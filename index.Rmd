# Terminology about misinformation

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/misinfoClasses.png")
```

- **False information:** 
  - False or fake news: news-like content that is verifiably false
  - False rumours: General talk or hearsay not based on factual knowledge
  - Factitious information blends: half-truths and speculations
  - Satire and parody
  - Deep fakes and cheap fakes

# Terminology about misinformation

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/misinfoClasses.png")
```

- **Information disorders:** 
  - Misinformation: false or misleading content shared without malicious intent
  - Disinformation: false or fabricated content shared with the intent to mislead or cause harm
  - Malinformation: true information shared to cause harm (hate speech, private information)

# Terminology about misinformation

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1200}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/misinfoClasses.png")
```

- **Propaganda:** Information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view. Can be political or industrial
- **Systematic lies:** Carefully constructed fabrications or obfuscations (e.g. weapons of mass destruction in Irak)
- **Conspiracy theories:** Alternative explanations for traditional news events which assume that these events are controlled by a secret elite group

## EAT-Lancet and yes2meat: Summary

- We mapped the digital backlash to EAT-Lancet on Twitter through #yes2meat

- Birth of #yes2meat preceded the release of the report

- Four communities: pro-EAT-Lancet, skeptic, pro-yes2meat, and vegan

- Information flow from pro-yes2meat to skeptic community after report

- Diet polarization: liberal vegan vs conservative keto

## Deliberate lies vs shock and chaos
.pull-left[
Two approaches to mislead the public:
- **deliberate lies** (e.g weapons of mass destruction in Iraq)
- **shock and chaos** (e.g. Trump's approach, Russia and MH17)
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=250}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/bush.jpg")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=270}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Trump.jpeg")
```
]
They differ in their **ontology of truth:**</br>
- deliberate lies assume a strong realism with the acceptance that truths exist and a respect for facts</br>
- shock and chaos assumes a strong constructivism where there is disbelief in the existence of external truths and a
disrespect of facts.

## Summary

- Misinformation beyond fake news: 
  - participatory propaganda 
  - new ontologies of truth: shock and chaos

- The EAT-Lancet case: emerging polarization in food topics

- The case of medical preprints on Twitter: increasing politicization

- Weighted Balance computational model explains increasing politicization

- PRODEMINFO: studying ontologies of truth to protect information spaces
